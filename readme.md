# My Learning Progress as a PhD Student @RPI
I started my PhD journey from September 2024 at RPI under the advise of [Prof. Qiang Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vAXmpVIAAAAJ&hl=en). During the first few months, my mainly topics will be **Uncertainty** in Deep Learning, say, the Probabilistic Machine Learning or Bayesian Machine Learning.
## Weekly Report
I will do weekly report to Prof. Ji, and I will upload my material (mainly presentation slides) here.

### 2024 Fall
