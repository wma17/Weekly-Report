# My Learning Progress as a PhD Student @RPI
I started my PhD journey from September 2024 at RPI under the advise of [Prof. Qiang Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vAXmpVIAAAAJ&hl=en). During the first few months, my mainly topics will be **Uncertainty** in Deep Learning, say, the Probabilistic Machine Learning or Bayesian Machine Learning.
## Weekly Report
I will do weekly report to Prof. Ji, and I will upload my material (mainly presentation slides) here.

## Paper Reading
I will record most of my reading progress (the material, the paper) here.

* A Primer on Bayesian Neural Networks: Review and Debates [[arxiv 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16314)]
* An Introduction to Bayesian Neural Networks @[ProbAI 2022 summer school] [[slides](http://yingzhenli.net/home/pdf/ProbAI2022_vi_bnn_tutorial.pdf)]
